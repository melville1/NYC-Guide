<h2>NYC-Guide</h2>

<h3>Welcome to the Big Apple!</h3>

<p>
And boy is it big! At over 300 square miles, no one would blame you for getting lost. What makes The City so special is it's rich diversity. In fact, Queens borough is often referred to as "The World's Borough" because of how many diverse ethnic groups live there. You can walk down the street and visit the world's cuisines all in a single block. It isn't an overstatement to say that in Queens you could have a Greek breakfast, Brazilian coffee, Lebanese falafel for lunch, and swing by your favorite Ethiopian restaurant for delectable awaze tibs for dinner.

This brings up an important feature of Gotham City. It is divided into five boroughs that each have their own unique characters and energies. Each of them (except for poor tiny Staten Island) could qualify as major cities in their own right! It is with the vastness of The Empire City in mind that we bring you this web guide. Right here, at your fingertips, you can preview all of the things that make NYC such a treat. Whether you're looking to visit it's iconic parks, get lost in a museum, or just take a nice relaxing day off at the beach, we provide you with the definitive guide to where you can find it. Happy traveling!
